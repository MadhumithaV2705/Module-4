## CLASS AND OBJECTS - AREA OF CIRCLE

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to take the radius from the user and find the area of a circle.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Import the **math** module to use the value of π.
3. Define a class `saveetha` with a method `slot(r)` that calculates the area of a circle using the formula **π × r²**.
4. Read the radius `r` from the user as an integer input.
5. Create an object `obj` of the class `saveetha` and call the `slot(r)` method to calculate the area.
6. Print the area of the circle rounded to 2 decimal places.
7. Terminate the program.

Name: Madhumitha V

import math
class saveetha:
    def slot(r):
        return math.pi*r*r
r=int(input())
obj=saveetha
print("Area of circle:", round(obj.slot(r),2))
```
